# Redis Adapter

The Redis adapter stores sessions in a Redis database. Unlike other adapters, it does not store user information. Therefore, you need to provide an additional adapter to retrieve user data from another database.

### Usage

1. **Create the Redis Adapter**

The Redis adapter requires a Redis client created using the `redis` package. It supports CRUD operations on sessions but needs an extra adapter for user data retrieval.

```ts copy
import { createClient } from "redis"
import { RedisAdapter } from "authy-js/adapters/redis"

// Create a Redis client with connection options
const client = createClient({})

// Create the Redis adapter, passing an additional adapter for user data retrieval
const adapter = new RedisAdapter({
    client,
    userDbAdapter: mongodbAdapter, // Adapter for the database storing user information
})
```

Once you have set up the additional adapter and passed it to the Redis adapter, you can use this adapter with all available handlers without any limitations.

### Methods

These methods are used by handlers.

-   **createSession**: Creates a new session in the database with the provided options.

-   **getSession**: Retrieves a session from the database using the session ID.

-   **deleteSession**: Deletes a session from the database using the session ID.

-   **getUserBySessionId**: Retrieves user information associated with a specific session ID.

-   **getUserByUserId**: Retrieves user information using the user ID.

-   **deleteUsersAllSessions**: Deletes all sessions associated with a specific user, identified by the session ID.
