# Handlers

Handlers are essential parts of our authentication library. They connect your application to different databases, like Redis and MongoDB, making it easy to switch databases when needed.

### How Do Handlers Work?

Handlers use adapters, which are modules that link to different databases. When you use a handler, it takes an adapter as a parameter to store and retrieve session data. This setup allows our library to support multiple frameworks and databases.

### Adding More Handlers

Our library is designed to be flexible. If you need to support more frameworks or databases, you can add more handlers. Each new handler should take an adapter as a parameter and define how to manage session data for that framework.

### Available Handlers

-   [Express](/handlers/express)
-   [Fastify](/handlers/fastify)

Handlers ensure your session management is strong and adaptable, providing a consistent and secure experience across different platforms and databases.
